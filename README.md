# ComputerGraphicsProject
This project is a level based, 3D third person platformer.  In this game the plyaer avoids obstacles, shoot enemies and platform in their attempt to reach the end of each stage.  

## Final Project:  
Credits: Line shadow texture was from tutorrial.  Bases of scripts were from lectures.  Probuilder and Cinemachine were used. 
All other textures, music and normal maps were made by us.

## Explainations  
Void Material  
This works similar to the rim lighting shader but it allows transparency and and alpha value.  The Saturation of the dot product of the normalised view direction and normal is set as the rim and that is then multiplied by the rim power.  This rim value is then applied to the level of colour and transparency the object has so that the center is the most opaque and coloured and the outer edges are transparents and lack colour.  

Decal  
Gets two textures and applies one on top of the other to give it more detail such as bullet holes or scorch marks  

Particles  
Applies a material to a sprite in the particle system to have various properties and functions appied to it.  

Depth of Field  
Blurs what is rendered in the camera by how far it is from the  camera.

### Explaination & Documentation  
Worked on scripts for a base of the project as they were already started on in the project and it didnt make sense to redo them.
Probuilder and https://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/ were used.

### Explaination & Documentation  
Some scripts like the base player and genral kill scrips were made as a group as a base and then edited in the scenes as the project was in progression and it would not be optimal to recode the same scripts and mechanics for the project multiple times over.  
Probuilder was used.

## Carlos Lu
Sound Designer  
- Creates the sound effects and soundtrack of the game, also assisting with vfx when needed.  
- Has a mini project along side the main game for additional content.
